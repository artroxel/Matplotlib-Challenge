In this challenge, I was given access to animal data from Pymaceuticals Inc. The data focused on tumor growth on mice, that had been treated by different drug regimens. I was assigned with comparing the drug of choice, Capomulin, to the other drugs that were tested. My first step was to drop and duplicate timepoints and data associated with it. I then created a summary statistic table consisting of mean, median, variance, standard deviation and SEM of the tumor volume for each of the drugs. I then displayed this data in various bar charts, pie charts, a box and whisker plot, a line plot, and finally a scatter plot that included a linear regression model. After displaying all of my data, I analyzed it and made observations.
